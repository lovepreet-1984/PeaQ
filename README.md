## 🛒 What I'm Working On

### 🧠 Smart E-commerce Web App
I'm building a **Django-based e-commerce platform** with powerful features, including:

- 🔍 **Web scraping** with Selenium to automatically pull product data (details, pricing, etc.) from retailers like **Brooks Brothers**.
- 🧠 **Automatic gender and category classification** for scraped products using custom logic and filters.
- 💳 **Stripe** integration for secure and reliable payments.
- 📱 **Twilio** integration for SMS/email-based phone and email verification.
- 🧾 Full authentication flow: register, login, password reset, and profile management.
- 🛍️ Cart, wishlist, and order history features with real-time interaction.
- 🎨 A responsive UI with:
  - Top header navigation with search bar and action buttons (profile, wishlist, cart).
  - Sidebar with collapsible **gender-based product categories**.
  - Dynamic product grid with live search and filtering.
